=CashPal=

This project was created to seamlessly connect online shoppers with cash-back savings.

==Abstract==
The website, built in the Ruby on Rails 2.3 framework, displayed searchable promotions, deals and coupons to users. It also allowed them access to their account to check their balance, cash-back earnings and purchases, as well as withdraw available cash to their bank account.

Automated scripts connected and aggregated new items and promos from affiliate networks, as well as account transactions. The website works in conjunction with a browser plugin.

==Note==
Due to the proprietary restrictions, some code in this repository has been intentionally clipped, rolled back, or excluded.
